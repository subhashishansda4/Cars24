    "The main objective of this mini-project is to develop skills in web scraping by extracting and analyzing car details of **HONDA** from Cars24.com for different locations. The key details to be gathered include kilometers driven, year of manufacture, fuel type, transmission, and price. This project provides hands-on experience in web scraping, essential for data extraction from online sources. By focusing on different locations, it allows for comparative analysis, revealing regional differences in car attributes and pricing. Ultimately, the project enhances data cleaning and structuring skills, which are crucial for any data analysis task."
